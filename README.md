# codenames_inspired_game

A script for playing a Codenames 🕵️ style game using Apples to Apples cards 🍏 (or any other word cards)

Just place 25 cards, each containing a word, in a square formation, then run the script to create the instruction card for the clue givers:

```
python3 code_names.py
```

The clue givers give one word hints for their color (blue or red). The grey dots are neutral and the black dot marks the assassin (instant loss) card.
